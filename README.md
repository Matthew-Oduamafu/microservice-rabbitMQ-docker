## Introduction

Microservices architecture allows you to break down your application into smaller, loosely coupled services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. This project showcases a complete microservices-based system using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.

## Features

- **Spring Boot**: Simplified development and deployment of microservices.
- **Spring Cloud**: Provides tools to quickly build some of the common patterns in distributed systems.
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration platform for deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications.
- **Docker**: Containerization of microservices to ensure consistency across different environments.
- **Zipkin**: Distributed tracing system for monitoring and troubleshooting microservices.
- **RabbitMQ**: Message broker for handling asynchronous communication between microservices.
- **Micrometer**: Metrics collection and monitoring for microservices using Prometheus, Grafana, etc.

## Technologies Used

- **Java 17**
- **Spring Boot**
- **Spring Cloud**
- **Kubernetes**
- **Docker**
- **Zipkin**
- **RabbitMQ**
- **Micrometer**

## Architecture

The project is built around a microservices architecture, where each service is independently deployable and loosely coupled. Below is a high-level overview of the architecture:

- **API Gateway**: Acts as an entry point to the system, routing requests to appropriate services.
- **Discovery Server (Eureka)**: Service registry for locating and managing microservices.
- **Configuration Server**: Centralized management of configuration properties.
- **Microservices**: Independently deployable services for handling different business functionalities.
- **Message Broker (RabbitMQ)**: For inter-service communication.
- **Tracing (Zipkin)**: For distributed tracing of requests across microservices.
- **Monitoring (Micrometer)**: For gathering and visualizing application metrics.

## Setup and Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/microservices-spring-cloud.git
   cd microservices-spring-cloud
